# Simple Blockchain Voting Contract (Solidity)
#### basic example of a blockchain voting system in Solidity, designed for Ethereum-compatible environments like Remix, Hardhat, or Foundry

## How it works:
- The contract is initialized with a list of proposal names.

- Each address can vote once.

- Votes are counted on-chain and publicly viewable.

- Anyone can see which proposal has the most votes and what its name is.
